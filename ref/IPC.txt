J is Java server
P is process
P < mean process reads one line
J > mean Java server writes one line
Both Java server and process can read and writes

Java server will write the HTTP method in at the start of the process

J > *HTTP method*
P < *HTTP method*

Now the process can send command to the server

req.path | req.fullPath
    P > *path command*
    J < ...
    J > *path*
    P < *path*

req.body
	This could be multi line output so the server will define a terminating word which will be written at the beginning and end of the body
    P > "req.body"
    J < "req.body"
    J > *terminating word*
    P < *terminating word*
    J > *first body line*
    P < *first body line*
    ...
    J > *last body line*
    P < *last body line*
    J > *terminating word*
    P < *terminating word*

req.bodySave
	P > "req.bodySave"
	J < "req.bodySave"
	J > *JSON array of file names saved to UPLOAD_DIR*
	P < *array of file names*


res.status
	P > "res.status"
	J < "res.status"
	P > *HTTP status*
	J > *HTTP status*

res.header
	P > "res.header"
	J < "res.header"
	P > *header key value pair*
	J < *header item*
	Java server will add to the response header

res.body
	This could be multi line output so the process must define a terminating word which must be written at the beginning and end of the body
	P > "res.body"
	J < "res.body"
	P > *terminating word*
	J < *terminating word*
	P > *fire body line*
	J < *fire body line*
	...
	P > *last body line*
	J < *last body line*
	P > *terminating word*
	J < *terminating word*

res.sendFile
	P > "res.sendFile"
	J < "res.sendFile"
	P > *absolute path to file*
	J < *absolute path to file*
